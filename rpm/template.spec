%description
A set of plugins for publishing and subscribing to sensor_msgs/Image topics in
representations other than raw pixel data. For example, for viewing a stream of
images off-robot, a video codec will give much lower bandwidth and latency. For
low frame rate tranport of high-definition images, you might prefer sending them
as JPEG or PNG-compressed form.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
